How to Pass Data From One Component to Other Component in React?
#
react
#
javascript
Alt Text

Props are used for passing data between the components. We usually use it to pass data from the parent component to the child component.

But what if you need to pass data from Child to Parent component? What if you need to pass data between siblings ??

There can be multiple ways of passing data from one component to another :

1. Using Props
You can use props to pass data from parent to child component. Example 1 illustrates the sample code for this.
|--- App.js
  |---- ParentComponent
       |----ChildComponent
2. Using React ContextAPI or State management library like Redux
Redux or React ContextAPI gives you the functionality of central state management to manage your application. It means all the application state will be stored in a single place known as Store.

Like a traditional database represents the point of record for an application, your Store can be thought of as a client-side ‚Äòsingle source of truth‚Äô, or database.

Alt Text

Example #1 ‚Äî Using Props to pass data from Parent Component to Child Component

ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react'
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';
fault ParentComponent;

ChildComponent.js
port default ChildComponent;

The above code snippets show how you can pass data from the Parent to Child component.

But, What if we need to pass data from Child to Parent Component ??? Let‚Äôs see this in the next!

3. Using Props as Callback Function
If you are not using any state management library like Redux or React ContextAPI and you need to pass data from Child to Parent Component, then callbacks come into the picture.
---App  
 |---- Table.js
    |---- ListItem.js
Preview

Alt Text

UseCase - When clicking on any rows on the table, Implement functionality to get that row data from the table and display on Table Main page.

Solution - Use Props as callback functions. Let‚Äôs see how in the example below!
import React from 'react'
import ListItem from './ListItem';

Precise write up, but for beginners i would recommend a learning curve though, start with passing props, then when you are comfortable with that you can move to using the Context Component, and when you feel boss in that too migrate to the big boys of Redux

Thanks Williams ! I really appreciate it !

You are right as a beginner it's good to first learn the basics then migrate to advanced concepts like Redux or ContextAPI that's why I have not covered these topics in detail.

However, it always better to know what are the possible way to do this.

Hey nice Post

Just a small feedback I think your post would much benefit on syntax highlighting on your code snippets

The business logics behind the data passing always confuses me no matter what technology I use
You made some great points! Nice job. Thanks

Let's understand the hierarchy if I understood your question.

Now, you are saying that I don't want to show content of child in parent. If the strucuture of Child -parent will be this, then the child content will be visible inside parent.

Let's understand the hierarchy if I understood your question.

Now, you are saying that I don't want to show content of child in parent. If the strucuture of Child -parent will be this, then the child content will be visible inside parent.
